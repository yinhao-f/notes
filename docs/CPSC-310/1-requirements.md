# Requirements

## Functional requirements

What the system must do. Functionalities, e.g. creating and deleting posts

## Non-functional requirements

Properties a system must have. Usability, qualities

## Software Requirements Specification (SRS)

A formal document that describes what the system should do

- Contract between stakeholders and developers
- Record-keeping, tracebility

Downsides:
- Can be too rigid for iterative (agile)
- Hard to maintain as software evolve
- Lack context of real use case
- Difficult for non-technical to understand

Solutions:
- Use cases: written description of actors and interactions with the system
- User stories: short, simple descriptions of a feature told from the perspective of the end user

## Validating requirements

Making sure requiremtns are correct, complete, consistent and feasible before development

## Ethics in software engineering

## Making requirements actionable
- Who needs this requirement?
- What
- Why

## User stories in large projects
- Themes
    - High-level, strategic
- Epics
    - Grouped together user stories
- User stories

## User stories
Commitment artifacts:
- Role goal benefit (or just user story)
- Definitions of done (aka acceptance criteria, solution of role goal benefit)

Engineering details:
- Engineering tasks

## Definition of Done (DoD)
- Unambiguous
- Testable

Common formats:
- Checklist
- Given/When/Then

## Story points
- Corresponds to how much time is needed to develop
- Can be used as estimate of development progress

## Accessing user stories INVEST
- Independent: stories should be independent of each other
- Negotiable: user fully understands the feature, able to add to the requirements later on
- Valuable: has value to the customer
- Estimatable: written precisely enough so developer can estimate how long it will take
- Small: should be 2-3 days to work for the team (sometimes single day)
- Testable: how developer knows it's done (DoD)
