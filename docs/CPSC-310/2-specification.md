# Specification

Unlike requirements, specifications are for developers to understand the goal

## Wicked problem

A problem that can only be defined by solving it

Traits:
- evolving
- conflict of interest
- interdependencies
- no clear goal

## Technical representations

Alternate views (abstractions): overlap, hard to be consistent:
- UML
- Architecture diagrams
- Class diagrams
- Sequence diagram
- State machine diagram
