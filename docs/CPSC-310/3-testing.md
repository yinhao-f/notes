# Testing strategies

## Ethics

## Static analysis

- Semantics and syntax
- Formatting (prettier, eslint)

## Kinds of tests by scope

- Speed
- Scope (targeted, broad)

Flaky tests: sometimes pass, sometimes fail  

- Unit tests: fast & targeted  
- Integration: how parts work together  
- End to end

## Kinds of test by purpose (test suites)

- Smoke
- Regression
- Acceptance
