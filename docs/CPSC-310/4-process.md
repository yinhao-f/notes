# Software process

- ensure developers and stakeholders are on the same page
- reduce risk

## Processes

### Waterfall

- earlier days, ~70s, companies like IBM
- "waterfall" from requirements to implementation
- can't go back to previous stages (maybe slightly)

### Spiral

- ~80s
- requirements, develop, back to customers, and repeat
- spiral down the development cycle

### Extreme programming

- failure not so costly
- paired programming

### Agile development

- simplify requirements
- user stories, TDD came in
- emergent design: start with minimum viable product, and grow from there
- refactor code
- Spikes
    - Architectural
    - user interface

## Scrum

- sprint backlog
- scrum scenario
    - three weeks
    - plan, code & test, ceremonies

### Scrum roles

- Product owner
    - defines and adjusts features
- Scrum lead

    - protects the scrum process
