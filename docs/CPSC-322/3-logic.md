# Logic

## Propositional definite clauses

- Knowledge base (KB) is true iff. every clause inside is true
- Model
    - an interpretation in which all the clauses (KB) are true
- Logical consequence
    - G is a conjunction of atoms
    - KB is a set of clauses
    - If G is true 
    - $KB \models G$

## Bottom-up proof

- Derive
